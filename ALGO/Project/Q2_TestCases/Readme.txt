1) Within each test case, the matrix 'T' and the pattern 'P' are provided, along with the expected result.

2) Format of the Matrices:
	Each row of a matrix is on a new line.
	Elements within a row are separated by commas.
	The end of a matrix row is marked by a trailing comma.

3) Parsing the Matrices:
	Split each line by the comma to get the individual elements of the matrix.
	Store these elements in a 2D array.
	
4) The next line given, is the pattern to find in the matrix(T).
	
5) The pattern given is a string which you will convert into a (nxn) matrix, that you will search for in the T.

6) Extracting the Expected Result:
	The expected result (Integer Value) for each test case is provided at the end of each case.
	It should be used to validate the output of your function or algorithm against the test case.

Note:) Additionally, analyze the time complexity of your algorithm.
	   The efficiency of the algorithm will be compared with the best-known solution.
	   Ensure your logic uses no more than a constant amount of extra space.
